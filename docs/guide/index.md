# Billing Solution Overview

Welcome to the Billing Solution documentation. This comprehensive system provides enterprise-grade billing management capabilities built on modern architectural patterns.

## System Overview

The Billing Solution is a domain-driven application that manages the complete billing lifecycle for organizations. Built with Vertical Slice Architecture principles and event-driven patterns, it provides a scalable and maintainable foundation for billing operations.

## Design Philosophy

This codebase follows a real-world mirroring approach:

-   **Product-Oriented**: Each folder represents a department with recognizable operations
-   **Minimal Abstractions**: No unnecessary layers - only what represents real-world entities
-   **Simple Records**: Invoices and cashiers are data records, not smart objects
-   **Clear Separation**: Front office (sync APIs) vs back office (async processing)
