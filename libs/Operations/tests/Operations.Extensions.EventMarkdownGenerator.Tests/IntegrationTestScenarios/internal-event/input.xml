            <summary>Published internally when audit log entries are created for compliance tracking</summary>
            <remarks>
            ## When It's Triggered
            
            This internal event is published when:
            - Sensitive operations are performed that require audit logging
            - Compliance-related actions need to be tracked
            - Internal system actions require monitoring
            
            ## Security Notice
            
            This is an internal event that should not be exposed to external systems.
            It contains sensitive audit information that must remain within the system boundary.
            
            ## Processing Requirements
            
            - Event must be processed within the same security context
            - Audit data must be encrypted at rest
            - Access requires elevated permissions
