            <remarks>
            ## When It's Triggered
            
            This event was published when:
            - Payment was processed through the old payment gateway
            - Transaction was completed successfully
            
            ## Migration Notes
            
            This event has been replaced by the new PaymentCompleted event which provides:
            - Enhanced payment method tracking
            - Better error handling and retry logic
            - Improved audit trail capabilities
