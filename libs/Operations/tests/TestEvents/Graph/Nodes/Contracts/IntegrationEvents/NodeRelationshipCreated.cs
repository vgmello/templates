/// ## When It's Triggered
/// 
/// This event is published when:
/// - New relationships are established between nodes
/// - Graph topology changes require notification
/// - Circular dependencies are intentionally created
/// 
/// ## Circular Reference Handling
/// 
/// This event contains types that reference each other in a circular manner:
/// - Node references Parent node
/// - Parent node references Child nodes
/// - Child nodes reference their Parent
/// - This tests the circular reference detection in schema generation
/// </remarks>
